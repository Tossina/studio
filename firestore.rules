/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the DagoPoker application,
 * employing a hybrid security model that segregates data based on access patterns.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The rules enforce a strict, user-centric security model. Data is structurally
 * segregated into private, shared, and public collections to ensure that authorization
 * logic remains simple, performant, and secure.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private data tree for each user, containing their profile
 *   and a subcollection for their transactions. Access is strictly limited to the
 *   document owner.
 * - /pokerGames/{pokerGameId}: A top-level collection for shared game documents.
 *   Access is managed on a per-document basis, granted to users listed as
 *   participants in the game.
 * - /aiOpponentProfiles/{aiOpponentProfileId}: A top-level collection for public,
 *   read-only reference data available to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only ever access documents within their own
 *   `/users/{userId}` path. Listing all users is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Shared Access via Denormalization: The `/pokerGames` collection relies on a
 *   denormalized `playerIds` array within each game document. This allows for
 *   efficient authorization checks without costly database queries.
 * - Read-Only System Data: Collections like `/aiOpponentProfiles` are configured
 *   to be read-only from the client-side, ensuring system data integrity.
 *   These would be managed through a trusted backend or the Firebase Console.
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default, and permissions are granted
 *   explicitly and granularly for each operation (get, list, create, update, delete).
